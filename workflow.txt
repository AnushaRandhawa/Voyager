Steps:

1. User navigates to the Timeline view and selects a specific day of the trip.

3. User adds a location (e.g., Departure for Neelum Valley").
4. The system saves the event and syncs it to every group member's personal in-app calendar.
5. The system triggers a push notification to all members 15 minutes before the next scheduled activity.

Post-condition: All travelers are kept on the same page regarding the daily plan, reducing delays and communication gaps.
